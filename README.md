## Bike Counter Dashboard

This personal project aims to create an application with a dashboard using open-source data provided by the city of Montpellier on bike counters. This project uses the Dash (by plotly), which is a framework for building data apps in Python. To find out more about Dash, see [Dash by plotly](https://dash.plotly.com/).

### Overview
This project utilizes publicly available data from the city of Montpellier's bike counters. The city has installed numerous bike counters at strategic locations to monitor and collect data on bike usage across the city. This project leverages this data to provide insights and visualizations through a user-friendly dashboard application.
